# Getting Started with BadUI

You just gotta make levels.

## Chat with AI
Feed it an existing level so it understands the modular system, and tell it what to build

## Paste the code
Make sure to add it to the levels file so it knows level data such as star timings

## Add a plus variant
Every level requires a challenge mode variant, with the title and a + at the end.
